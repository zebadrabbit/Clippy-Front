## Storage Quotas

### What Counts Toward Storage

- Uploaded media files
- Downloaded clips
- Intros, outros, transitions
- Final compilations

### What Doesn't Count

- Project metadata
- Thumbnails
- Temporary processing files

### Managing Storage

**Check usage:**
- Media Library shows current usage
- Progress bar indicates percentage

**Free up space:**
1. Delete old compilations
2. Remove unused clips
3. Clean up duplicates
4. Download and remove large files

## Compilation Length Limits

### Why Limits Exist

Longer compilations:
- Use more processing power
- Take longer to render
- Consume more storage

### Working Within Limits

**Free tier (5 minutes):**
- Focus on highlights
- Keep clips short (10-20 seconds)
- Minimal intro/outro

**Basic tier (15 minutes):**
- Weekly compilations
- Mix of clip types
- Short intro/outro (3-5 seconds)

**Pro tier (30 minutes):**
- Monthly compilations
- Full episodes
- Multiple segments

### If You Hit the Limit

- Trim clips before adding
- Remove less interesting parts
- Split into multiple videos
- Upgrade tier for more time

## Project Limits

### Concurrent Projects

Number of active projects you can have:

- **Active** = Draft, In Progress, or Processing
- **Completed** projects don't count
- Delete or complete old projects to free slots

### Total Projects

No limit on total projects:
- Only concurrent/active projects count
- Complete and archive old ones
- Delete projects you don't need

## Output Quality Limits

### Resolution Caps

Your tier limits maximum output:

| Tier | Max Resolution | Max FPS |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Free | 1280×720 | 30 |
| Basic | 1920×1080 | 30 |
| Pro | 1920×1080 | 60 |
| Enterprise | 3840×2160 | 60 |

### Choosing Platform Presets

Platform presets auto-select appropriate settings:
- YouTube: 1080p (requires Basic+)
- TikTok: 1080×1920 (requires Basic+)
- Twitter: 720p (works on Free)

**Tip**: Tier limits override preset choices.
