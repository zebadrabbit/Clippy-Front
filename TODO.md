## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Missing Core Features

### ✅ Sprint 2 Complete (4 hours) - 2025-11-21

**2. Discord Route Enhancement** - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Wizard UI** (1 hour):
  - Discord parameters card with min reactions, emoji filter, channel ID inputs
  - Show/hide logic based on route selection (initialized on page load)
  - Updated fetchDiscordClips() to pass parameters via query string
  - Display filtered count and reaction threshold in status

- ✅ **Discord Integration** (2 hours):
  - Added reactions field to get_channel_messages() response
  - Implemented filter_by_reactions() function with:
    - Minimum total reaction count filtering
    - Optional emoji-specific filtering (unicode and :name: support)
    - Normalized emoji comparison (case-insensitive, colon-stripping)

- ✅ **API Endpoint Updates** (1 hour):
  - Added min_reactions parameter (default: 1, backward compatible)
  - Added reaction_emoji parameter (optional)
  - Returns filtered_count and total_count
  - Enhanced error logging with reaction context
  - Updated docstring with examples

- ✅ **URL Extraction** (integrated):
  - Extracts Twitch URLs from reaction-filtered messages only
  - Existing regex handles clips.twitch.tv and twitch.tv/user/clip/ formats

**Testing:**
- ✅ Unit tests pass for reaction filtering logic
- ✅ All imports successful
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Backward compatible (default behavior unchanged)

**Workflow:**
1. Community posts Twitch clip URLs in Discord channel
2. Users react with emojis (👍, ⭐, 🔥, etc.) to curate best clips
3. ClippyFront fetches messages and filters by reaction threshold
4. Only clips meeting minimum reactions are downloaded
5. Reduces spam/low-quality content automatically

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Enhancements
**Current State:** Discord route exists but lacks community curation workflow
**Issue:** Need to leverage Discord as a curation layer for Twitch clips
**Workflow:**
1. Community posts Twitch clip URLs in Discord channel
2. Users react with emojis (👍, ⭐, 🔥, etc.) to curate best clips
3. ClippyFront fetches messages and filters by reaction threshold
4. Only clips meeting minimum reactions are downloaded
5. Reduces spam/low-quality content automatically

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Enhancements

### 6. Notification System SSE Upgrade (2 hours)
**Current:** 30-second polling in navbar bell icon
**Available:** SSE endpoint at `/api/notifications/stream` (just fixed!)
**Upgrade Path:**
1. Replace polling with `EventSource` in `base.html`
2. Listen for SSE events
3. Update badge count in real-time
4. Update dropdown list on new notifications
5. Fallback to polling if SSE connection fails
**Benefits:**
- Instant notification delivery (no 30s delay)
- Reduced server load (no constant polling)
- Better UX (immediate feedback)

- [ ] Project sharing with teams

### 7. Worker Documentation Updates (1-2 hours)
**Location:** `docs/WORKER_API_MIGRATION.md`
**Remaining TODOs (line 244):**
- Document Phase 5 cleanup process
- Update `.env.worker.example` to remove DATABASE_URL

- Real-time collaboration (simultaneous editing) - Too complex
- Mobile app - Web responsive is sufficient
- AI-powered features - Not core requirement
- Live streaming integration - Different use case
