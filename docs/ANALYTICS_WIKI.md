## Understanding the Data

### Where Does This Data Come From?

- Creator names, game names, and timestamps
- Updates when you re-fetch clips for a project

**Discord Integration**
- Shares counted when clips posted to configured channels
- Reactions tracked from Discord messages
- Emoji breakdown (👍, 🔥, etc.)

### What Counts as a "Clip"?

## Tips for Better Insights

### Get More Accurate Data

1. **Fetch Clips Regularly**
   - View counts update on Twitch over time
   - Re-fetch to get latest numbers

2. **Configure Discord Integration**
   - Set your Discord channel ID in profile
   - Ensure bot has read message history permission
   - Reaction tracking requires message content intent

3. **Use Consistent Time Periods**
   - Compare week-to-week or month-to-month
   - Account for seasonal variations
   - Track trends over multiple periods

### Interpret Metrics Carefully

**High Clip Count ≠ High Engagement**
- Many low-view clips might indicate spam/bots
- Quality over quantity for viral potential

**Average Views is Key**
- 10 clips with 1000 avg views > 100 clips with 100 avg views
- Indicates content quality and shareability

**Discord Activity Shows Community**
- High shares = clips people want to show friends
- Reactions = emotional connection to content
- Emoji types reveal sentiment (🔥 vs. 😂)

## Common Questions

### Why are my view counts low?

- Clips need time to accumulate views
- Re-fetch clips after a few days for updated counts
- Share clips on social media to boost visibility

### Why don't I see any creators?

- You need to have fetched clips via Twitch integration
- Ensure clips have creator metadata (some old clips don't)
- Check that Twitch API connection is working

### Why is my game data incomplete?

- Twitch API sometimes doesn't include game for very old clips
- Manually added clips might not have game info
- Re-fetch from Twitch to enrich metadata

### Can I export this data?

Currently, analytics are view-only in the dashboard. Export features are planned for future releases.

### How far back does data go?

Analytics start from when clips are first added to your projects. Historical data before using ClippyFront is not available.
